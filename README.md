# Global Average Temperatures 1880 - 2020

##  Description
This project was inspired by my _interest_ toward computer programming and the devastating effects of *Global Warming*.

The graph above shows _drastic_ *increase* in *Global Temperatures* which overall illustates why it is important to "save" our earth(_sarcasm_). 

## Food for thought...
The truth is the earth doesn't need saving. It's going to be here regardless of whether it is 500 Degrees Celsius or 5 Degrees Celsius. _But the question is will we be here?_ *We NEED SAVING.* _We need to SAVE ourselves, not the Earth._
